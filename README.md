# Sentiment Detection using Doc2Vec and Support Vector Machines

Pang et al. (2002) were the first to introduce the task of sentiment classification.
Using a dataset of movie reviews, they showed that a Support Vector Machine trained on unigrams
outperforms human-produced baselines and other classifiers. In this paper, we improve on their
results by combining the recently developed Doc2Vec model with a Support Vector Machine. We show
that our model performs well on reviews of films of various years and genres. Analyzing the errors
made by the model, we show that they are mainly due the lack of a complete semantic understanding of
the language. Finally, we investigate the embedding space learned by the Doc2Vec model, showing
that it captures meaningful but not perfect similarities between words and documents.
