Black Panther,"I went to see Black Panther along with my friends, and following the hype train we were excited to see it. However, following the showing we were all dissapointed by a mess of a movie with little plot and little thought which only served as a pit stop for infinity war. The critics have vastly overrated this movie due to its groundbreaking cast, but the movie itself is not at all groundbreaking. Littered with all the boring Marvel clich√©s I have come to know and hate, such as their inability to kill off any hero's to add gravitas to their story, or the one dimensional villain who only exists for one movie so you know they will kill him off before the next, Black panther is also plagued by new problems no one but me seemed to notice. For example, the CGI was awful in the action scenes: whenever someone was even prodded, they would go flying across the screen in the most outlandish fashion, and the plot was torn straight out of the Lion King, as well as having the biggest waste of Martin Freeman since those Vodafone adverts. Overall, I believe my dissapointment for this movie is fuelled by the marvel cinematic universe, as I feel sick of the movies they are pumping out like an industrial machine, as they all feel the same with little originality. I can only hope the bubble will burst sometime soon, and bring back true standalone movies which don't need a cinematic universe.",1,neg
Black Panther,"This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not, I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys.",2,neg
Black Panther,"I had high hopes for this movie after the stellar reviews started rolling in, but to be perfectly honest, this movie is EXTREMELY boring... One of the only action scenes in the movie is the air flip over the car you see in the trailer. The other is the awkwardly short ""climax"" at the end. Seriously, it's over so fast you won't believe it's really over. It felt like the director just wanted to call it a day and be done with this movie. Ultimately I feel really cheated after how amazing BP was in Civil War. Take a pass on this one, the critics are lying.",3,neg
Black Panther,"In such a multicultural society like the United States, it would be surprising if, sooner or later, in the pages of the popular comic book does not appear the first black superhero capable of on a par with Spider-Man, Thor and Iron Man to resist the threat of danger, experiencing the Earth's defense strength. There was such a significant event in the summer of 1966, when in the 52nd issue of the ""Fantastic Four"" magazine, from the filing of Wall and Lee Kirby appeared the proud T'challa, Crown Prince of the fictional African country Wakanda. The emergence of the superhero with a characteristic color, traditionally incredible abilities and characteristic behavior could not get past the various ethnic groups in America and soon T'challa popularity reached unprecedented heights and rapid, then it without much thought in a row the team the Avengers. And in spite of the fact that the prince, and then the full-fledged ruler of Wakid, was only one of the knights of the image of the ""Black Panther"", it was T'chall who became associated with fans of graphic novels with this character who had a great future ahead of him. Having firmly established itself as its own personal series of comic books, T'challa appeared consistently in so-called crossovers and even managed to lead a charming Storm under the crown, who agreed to become the second half of such an outstanding personality. In addition to participating in various kinds of print adventures, the hero repeatedly appeared in animated sketches from Marvel, reminding the audience that he is unique and can not be written off. And in the early '90s, when the shooting process technology began to show an unprecedented rise itself Wesley Snipes tried to present themselves before us in the guise of the ""Black Panthers"", but constant creative differences and other production problems at the root hacked promising ideas. And yet in the depths of Marvel no one was going to give up the opportunity to transfer the history of T'Challa to big screens. Of course, it took much longer than Stan Lee planned, and yet the ""Black Panther"" merged into a harmonious series of screened characters of the publishing house and rightfully took the leading positions in the Kino-Universe supervised by Kevin Feigi.
 
 Produced by Marvel for a long time tried to introduce T'challu an endless success story begun in Jon Favreau, ""Iron Man"", trying as gently as possible to bring to build a mythology movie, the universe for a meeting with an idol of the black community. And the best option was the invitation of T'Challa to the conflict, called the ""Civil War"". Friendly confrontation between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers gradually grew into by a serious, albeit not the most dramatic battle, and T'challa fully demonstrated its unique features, trying to avenge his father's untimely deceased in eternity. Played quite remarkable and not untalented actor Chadwick Bozeman character exuded confidence and unwavering despite the deep emotional conflicts tormenting his soul, managed to find a balance, thereby demonstrating the wisdom that came too early, but the world needs, more than ever before. In itself, the plot of the Civil War caused ambiguous feelings among Marvel fans, especially if we compare the scale of events in the movies with what was happening in the comics, but T'challa did not raise any doubts about the expediency of his appearance, and therefore Kevin Feigi gave the go-ahead on the shooting of the solo output of the ""Black Panther"" under the direction of Ryan Krugler, one of the most interesting directors with a dark complexion, who was obliged to feel with the history of T'challa kinship and show us previously unknown regions of the Movie Universe, to they are destined to play a significant role in the further development of the conflict under the sign of the ""Stones of Eternity"". So, the plot of the film unfolds in a remote and closed African country Wakanda, which managed to reach unprecedented technological heights due to the myriad deposits of outlandish metal. Developing aside from the major world markets and, consequently, conflicts, Wakanda managed to preserve its identity and at the same time create an exemplary unity of the society in which conflicts start and are happening, but they can always be resolved by the affairs of honor. Entering the throne of a small but proud country, the young heir of the late King T'Chall (Bozeman) decides to continue the policy of isolating the Wakis for the benefit of their own people, never in need of anything, but events in the recent past compel the Black Panther to seriously reconsider their life position. The world was no longer as huge as it was some 10 years ago. Globalization, which picks up the Earth in a whirlpool of cosmic proportions, is also clinging to T'Challa's home, which among other things attracts scoundrels of various colors ready to sell their souls for the treasures and knowledge of the Wakid.
 
 Contrary to the specific geographical location of the ""Black Panther"", it does not feel at all camera and alien. Ryan Krugler's ribbon fits perfectly into the framework of the Marvel Cinema-Universe, showing a charming and, of course, embellished African flavor for the joy of a few tired of the monotony of the previous series of films to the audience. The title character in the invariable performance of Chadwick Bozeman is revealed to us on the best side, demonstrating an excellent physical form and ability to win back emotions that make him a living person, not a schematic heroic character. The actor became the real property of the ""Black Panther"", he skillfully plays out even the most difficult by the standards of Marvel dramatic scenes and manages to joke so that he is not ashamed of him. Of course, by the will of the fate of T'Challa has no right to be merry to the bone, as his country is torn by a serious conflict, but the game of Bozeman takes the hero out of the walls of gloomy reflections and volitional actions in order to show the true humanity of the ""Black Panther"". Thus, T'challa becomes almost the most interesting character of Marvel since the days of Tony Stark, and although there is not so much eccentricity in him, the hero completely takes the niche taken by Kevin Feigi. And the history of the ""Black Panther"" is filed so competently that not only African-American viewers will be able to fall in love with it, but also a different category of viewers. And all because Ryan Krugler, Chadwick Bozeman and the unchallenged curator Kevin Feigi understand what they need to do. Certainly, the film has strong ethnic roots, only for a skilfully told story that in fact has nothing to do. Regardless of skin color, each of us has the concept of beauty. And the ""Black Panther"" is proof that a tightly-shot movie will always find attention and become a favorite for millions.
 
 As a result, I want to say that the film by Ryan Krugler reveals wonderful beauties before us, reveals a serious layer of history, is not afraid of bold artistic decisions and at the same time gives Marvel audience a pleasant feeling of comfort. ""Black Panther"" is colorful, spectacular and epic. It does not violate the laws and stylistics of the Cinema-Universe, which also pleases. Of course, the authors would not be prevented from taking a partial example with the permissiveness of Taiki Vaitichi, the author of the third ""Torah"", but it is clear that Marvel is increasingly willing to trust the original vision of the directors and still give them the necessary sip of creative freedom. The Krugler tape is proof.",8,pos
Black Panther,"Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan. Pros: Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics. As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons: The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A.",9,pos
Black Panther,"First of all, I'm glad that great ratings are continuing to climb on this film despite the phony low reviews that have been given here. My experience after watching it twice and also planning watching a third time, believe the hype.
 
 Ryan Coogler does an excellent job and the actors are incredible. He knows who his strong actors are and they deliver 110%. He made Michael B. Jordan's role as Killmonger so complex that you didn't know whether to dislike him or be on his side despite how menacing he was. I cannot wait to see him in Creed 2 so I can be reminded it that he really is a good person lol!
 
 This movie doesn't really show heavy action for Black Panther (you get that intro in Civil War) but it introduces you more to how he operates as the new king, and the choices he will have to make. However, leaves you satisfied just the same.
 
 Ludwig Gorranson who does an excellent job with the music score, is no stranger when it comes to working with Ryan, as he has worked with him in Fruitvale Station and Creed. The music score is a character within itself, as they literally speak for Black Panther/T'Challa and Killmonger during their quiet moments. The research and tours with these excellent musicians during his visits to so many countries in Africa really showed, and I understand why Coogler likes working with him.
 
 I do hope people do not fall for these bad reviews which are obviously there to try to scare people away. My parents are not even into comics and they enjoyed every second. For a lengthy movie, it didn't even feel like you were there that long. Go see the movie for yourselves. Everyone isn't lying when you hear the majority saying something is that great.",10,pos
A Star is Born,"Lady Gaga can sing, but i can not say therefore that was a good movie. I was waiting the whole time when the heck this movie would end. I do not recommend it.",1,neg
A Star is Born,"Gaga is one of the best voices there is but the songs are as terrible as the laziest pop songwriters can go, so there goes the voice. first 30 minutes was a bit watchable, Cooper was being a overly deep, sympathetic drunk, gaga was..gaga? ..then the plot deploys and removes the watchableness..not worthy of paing money to watch, watched bad times at the el royale last friday because this was sold out and that was by far a more enjoyable movie",2,neg
A Star is Born,"Cooper's painfully earnest depiction of a (very unlikeable and greasy-haired) addict is far too heavy for this frothy material. As one reviewer said, more 'A Star Goes Out' than 'A Star Is Born'. At least the self-indulgent focus on him spares us much of Gaga's precariously near-wooden acting. If Cooper was insistent on giving it the heavy-handed treatment he should have had the character's addiction stem from the pressures of fame and not from his family background. The resulting premise makes the music industry setting redundant. Subsequently, there is no palpable reason for tension between the leads, which makes for a very lacklustre experience. This might have been saved by a crackle of sexual chemistry but there is none. Cooper looks good without his shirt on but so what? Nobody wants to stare at those two weird faces for two and half hours. Some of the gruff-voiced dialogue is embarrassing (Sam Elliott, anyone?). Following in the unfortunate footsteps of 'Mother!' and 'Hereditary', it's unintentionally funny in parts and boring in others. The songs aren't bad but they're not in the same league as those from the 1976 version. Gaga's performance on the stage is, of course, good but not that good. She screeches out the songs from the beginning and consequently has nowhere to go for the denouement. Let's face it, she has about a quarter of Streisand's talent and none of the charisma. I can see the effort, but mediocre results. Next!",3,neg
A Star is Born,"This is the 4th version of A Star Is Born I've seen - 5th if you count What Price Hollywood - each version had a life of their own and reflected the times of the time in which it was made. The 2018 version is no exception. For me represented also the revelation of Lady Gaga as a phenomenal film presence. She is, quite simply, superb. Moving, powerful and real. Janet Gaynor had brought a form of overwhelming innocence, Judy Garland exploded in heartbreak in a Hollywood that doesn't exist anymore and she was, unquestionably, memorable. Barbara Streisand was tough with a strong sense of self even during her tribulations. Lady Gaga brings a little of each of them as well as something profoundly personal. Kudos to Bradley Cooper. His Norman Maine has a new name and a totally new presence. At times this version seems more about him than about her. In any case, I loved them both - Bravo!",8,pos
A Star is Born,"If you're even a casual moviegoer, chances are you have already heard the argument; that originality is dead in Hollywood. We live in an era where even Ghostbusters is no longer sacred. Where you wouldn't be surprised if one of the large studios announced a remake of the Godfather or Citizen Kane. Those remakes might capture some audience members, but those films almost certainly don't capture the audience's hearts. They certainly don't capture the praise critics. They certainly don't take home any major awards.
 
 That all changes with A Star is Born.
 
 Change, however, is a key word when it comes to remakes. (Or remakes of remakes of remakes...) In order to make the venture worthwhile, the film makers not only have to stay close to the ideas of original film, but they have to have a reason to retell the story. It's a delicate balance. Every version of a Star is Born follows a broken celebrity, in the Winter of his career, damaged by years of drinking who is suddenly reborn when meeting a young ing√©nue. The two fall in love, but while their relationship develops, their entertainment careers go in different directions.
 
 Director and Co-Star Bradley Cooper's film seemingly borrows more from the Streisand/Kristofferson iteration of A Star is Born (the last time this story was retold), as the dynamic between the two lovers hinges on the music industry. When Streisand and Kristofferson remade the film, (for the fourth time at that point) in 1976, they broke one of the aforementioned expectations, as they both took home Golden Globes for their performances. Perhaps Cooper was more inspired by performance, rather than aesthetic, as the acting is one aspect out of many that shines in Cooper's version. The characters of Jackson Maine (Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga) drive the entire story in what is essentially a film with only half a dozen notable characters. Cooper and Lady Gaga have amazing chemistry, and from the moment you see the two on screen together for the first time you feel the connection.
 
 First time director, Cooper, deftly creates intimacy between Jackson and Ally, without which the story would certainly not be as successful. In stadiums housing thousands of fans, in small dressing rooms packed with screaming Drag Queens, in a loud dive bar, in the parking lot of an all-night-grocer, Cooper uses tight framing and sound impeccably to make it seem like they're the only two people in the world. You understand his charm, you see her vulnerability, and the two actors give side-by-side stellar performances.
 
 That isn't to take away anything from a small, but powerful supporting cast. There were some brilliant and surprising moments from Dave Chappelle as Noodles, an old friend of Jackson's who reiterates how much Ally has revitalized Jackson. The largest surprise came from Andrew Dice Clay as Lorenzo, Ally's father. Both Clay and Chappelle brought great moments of love and humanity in their criminally small interactions with the two main characters. Sam Elliot also surprised me in his role as Bobby, Jackson's (much) older brother. They explain the age discrepancy, but the rest is self-explanatory as he and Cooper truly are brothers on screen, with all the frustration, fights and familiarity that goes with that relationship. Elliot in his similarly small time on screen, often showed the softer side of his craft, hiding touching instants of sadness when it comes to his difficult relationship with his brother, concealed only slightly by his iconic mustache.
 
 It begs the question, does Cooper deserve all the praise as director, or does the cast? What I can glean from the film is Cooper definitely had his cast on the same page, as regardless of screen time, these actors made you care about their characters. The audience is invested. There are countless pivotal story beats where these characters may do something frustrating or angering. Instead of merely recognizing that these are hurdles to push the story further, I found myself almost vocally upset, akin to yelling at a character in a horror film to not go in the room where the killer is hiding. This film makes you want the protagonists to succeed, even when dealing with topical subplots regarding celebrity, regret, depression and substance abuse.
 
 And that's because you're along for the ride the entire time. You're a part of this love story. The film sucks you in from the beginning with the roar of a raucous concert audience, the hard beat of the drums on Jackson's stage, and his hypnotic swagger as he plays for thousands. If you were one of the millions of people who have seen the trailer for this film, I'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about (kudos to the promotional department of this film, as that, is an extremely engaging and powerful trailer) but it stems from an extremely engaging and powerful film. The music, much like it did with the trailer gets inside you, not just inside your head where you find yourself humming a gentle country lilt sang by Cooper, it gets inside your heart and soul and rattles around. It repeats over and over until you're the one who doesn't want to let go. While Cooper should be commended for taking his craft seriously and improving his singing, this is where Lady Gaga shines, to no one's surprise.
 
 Ally is a perfect role for her. The performer has spoken about how vulnerable and ugly she felt in some scenes when shooting this film, but it made her so real on screen. Ally's career, much like the first half of the film, blasts off, and all you can do is hold on until you realize the songstress is belting a powerful ballad. You wonder, much like her character ""how did we get here"" but at that point, you're just happy to be along for the ride. It is a testament to Lady Gaga's ability, because being such an iconic figure, if it weren't for her conveyance of sincerity and humility, the character's journey would seem forced and unfulfilling. Because of Gaga's performance, however, you relish the moment Ally can finally embrace who she is and bravely belt out her songs with no inhibition. In a film with so many moments that grab you, the music is undeniably one of my favorite aspects. I can't wait for this film to get a wider release so the studio can also make the soundtrack available.
 
 If and when Award season comes, and A Star is Born is undeniably a forerunner for several major awards, I think Cooper should be commended simply because as director, he brought everything together. The songwriters, the actors, the cinematography, the sound design was superbly balanced to create the best possible version of this story making it, the brightest star for both critics and audiences.",9,pos
A Star is Born,"I did not want to watch this movie but took my wife to see it, because we both saw the one with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, growing up. The crowd was a lot older than we were(we are almost 50) it was the biggest screen they had at our theater and seats a lot but it was maybe half full on Sunday afternoon. Not one dry eye in the place, it had a great tempo and didn't drag on or have any lulls in the story. We were both very pleased and are still engaging in conversations about the movie. It's my opinion to highly recommend to everyone go out and watch a great movie and a heartfelt movie that redefines love in this time and age we live in. That is my two cents, hope you enjoy as much as we have.",10,pos
Annihilation,"A meteorite strikes a lighthouse on the southeastern US coast and a mysterious 'Shimmer Zone' begins expanding from the impact point. The government keeps the event a secret and sends military units into the area. None of these personnel ever return, until the special forces husband of an ex-Army biologist called Lena suddenly shows up at their home. He's been missing for a year, remembers little of it, and immediately falls seriously ill. After this 15 minute prologue, Lena joins the next all-female expedition. The five women enter the zone, witness disturbing events and discover their communications devices no longer work. Rather than return to base and report these discoveries, they push on, making more foolish decisions as they proceed, until they resemble dim-witted teenagers in a slasher pic.
 
 Many sci-fi fans will recall JG Ballard conceived the original idea of an expanding zone where the laws of nature are transformed. By comparison to Ballard's 1966 novel 'The Crystal World', Garland's film of Jeff VanderMeer's copycat story is a conventional adventure movie spiced up with some sci-fi mumbo-jumbo. The military and scientific background becomes increasingly unbelievable as routine action sequences and CGI pyrotechnics overwhelm all the grown-up possibilities. 'Annihilation' ends up as inconsequential as Garland's 2007 'Sunshine' screenplay - and after 'Ex Machina', it's a major disappointment.",1,neg
Annihilation,"First of all this movie was not confusing, nor was it thought provoking. I get the idea of morphology, the shimmer refracting dna and the idea of one's own self destruction to becoming something new/ different. Those ideas were cool, but that's not what I have issues with. It's hard to take this movie as a deep, intellectual movie when common sense and basic logic is all tossed aside. Here is a list of things that I couldn't get passed in this movies:
 
 1. The team. Only one person had military training yet they were all given automatic weapons? 
 
 2. The biologist doesn't wear gloves when swabbing specimens? Who cares about contamination right?
 
 3. Everyone they sent into the shimmer has died and never made it back except one guy who is dying and coughing up blood. They kept him in a quarantined area and wore hazmat suits around him, but they go into the shimmer unprotected?
 
 4.This is a military/government operation, where's the military? It would have made more sense to send a team of scientist in with a team of trained military professionals. I get the girl power in this, but you could have sent them in with an all female unit.
 
 5. You kill a giant, vicious mutated gator and decided the best mode of transportation is to get in the water on tiny row boats? People! We are talking about a gator that is on steroids and has severe roid rage! This place is a swamp! 
 
 6.Their idea of standing on guard at night is to have one person on the ground 200 ft away from everyone in a small guard shack that has no walls where something can grab you from all angles while everyone else was high up in a lookout tower. There was a balcony on the tower that had one set of stairs that went up it. That is where you put your guard. 
 
 7.Who the hell packed their gear? No night vision goggles? No secondary side arms? No masks in case of deadly spores?
 
 Now. I am not saying do not watch this movie. You can do whatever you want. It's your choice. You might like it and not be bothered by the things I listed.What I am saying is that I cannot agree with those that are praising this as the best sci-fi movie or that it's the most intelligent one. For every intellectually stimulating subject that's touched in the movie is quickly overshadowed by some boneheaded decisions and actions.
 
 There are (in my opinion) better Sci-fi movies out there. Arrival, Blade Runner 1 and 2, Ex Machina, Any Star Trek movie, District 9, 2001, Alien and Aliens, Predator, The Maze Runner, The Matrix, Close Encounters, The Edge of Tomorrow, Minority Report, Interstellar, Dune...
 
 You want thought provoking movies? Check out these: Arrival, Memento, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, The Number 23, The Count of Monte Cristo...",2,neg
Annihilation,"From the trailer I was expecting an action-packed sci-fi thriller... but I was very misled. What I watched was nearly 2 hours of mind-numbing tedious garbage. Nothing is really ever explained, everyone talks very slowly (I am assuming they are trying to create suspense, but it is very unnatural) - the whole setup just seems very odd and illogical for a group of women scientists preparing to venture into someplace treacherous and unknown.
 
 I will say the special effects and CGI were very good - so it did have spectacular visuals - the only reason I am giving 3 stars. Everything else was either mediocre or awful - and too often illogical.
 
 Spoilers ahead...
 
 Some of the stupid things that happen in the movie:
 
 Despite 3 years of study - sending in teams and drones - running tests at the perimeter - no one inside of a scientific (government?) facility has any information regarding what is going on inside of this bubble-like anomaly encapsulating an area of swamp and coastline - they call it inside ""The Shimmer.""
 
 A female psychologist plays the tough bad-ass character. Not the paramedic or former soldier - no the psychologist (you would assume a psychologist might be sensitive and sweet). And for some reason this psychologist has been making the decisions regarding who enters this anomaly (a.k.a. The Shimmer). I'm not even sure she is part of the government - which I assumed was in control of the facility because they capture Lena's escaped husband in the beginning third of the movie.
 
 A male soldier's insides have been completely mutated and swirling around like a worm, but somehow he is still alive. Upon seeing this on video, a former paramedic exclaims it was a lighting trick and to not believe what they just saw (Aside: pretty much all of us in the theater burst out laughing).
 
 A former soldier is using night-vision goggles to see out into the dark - but she's standing in the middle of a booth-type structure with the lights on - which obviously would disrupt the ability to use the night-vision goggles.
 
 Cells extracted and plated from Lena's blood are rapidly dividing and mutating, but somehow she is not extremely sick and dying?
 
 The ending is so exceptionally weird that I'm not sure a written description could even come close to accurate. It tries very hard to be artistic and deep / mind-bending, but instead comes off silly and trite.",3,neg
Annihilation,"After watching this film I read the reviews voted ""most helpful,"" which all were long lists of plot holes and logical inconsistencies. They are absolutely right. I didn't think about it while watching the film, but when it's pointed out, yeah, nothing in this movie makes much sense.
 
 But I still really liked it. It's creepy and atmospheric and more concerned with the psychology of people on a suicide mission than on the nuts and bolts of scientific investigation. It's often intense , usually beautiful, well acted, and had some really weird and mesmerizing moments. 
 
 I won't argue that you should forgive it for its plot holes, or that it has any deep meaning, or anything like that. In fact, it's probably easier to make a convincing argument against the movie than for it. I'm just saying, I really liked it.",8,pos
Annihilation,"ANNIHILATION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)
 
 The new science fiction horror flick from writer/director Alex Garland (who also performed both duties on 2014's 'EX MACHINA'). It's about a biologist who volunteers to lead an expedition into a dangerous environmental zone, after her husband comes out of the zone seriously injured, and the sole survivor of his expedition. It's based on the novel, of the same name, by Jeff VanderMeer. The film stars Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Isaac. It's gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, but it also performed really poorly at a test screening (which prompted a Netflix release overseas, instead of a theatrical one). I think the film is a very dark and bizarrely beautiful sci-fi masterpiece, and I can also see why a lot of people won't like it. 
 
 A year has passed since a team of soldiers entered an environmental disaster zone, and never returned. One soldier, named Kane (Isaac), suddenly reappears, much to the desperate relief of his biologist wife Lena (Portman), but he doesn't remember where he's been or how he got home. Then he has a sudden medical emergency, and is rushed to a hospital. In an attempt to help him, Lena decides to join a team of all female scientists, on an expedition back into the environmental zone. Things of course don't go as planned.
 
 The movie is very hauntingly beautiful, and it's especially highlighted by an awesomely haunting score, and some breathtaking visuals. The story is interesting, but it's definitely slow-paced, and the climax is much more of an intellectual payoff than a spectacular action scene (which many viewers might be hoping for). So I can definitely see why some people would hate this film, but I loved it. It's one I definitely won't forget anytime soon too, and it's great to see Natalie Portman (my old favorite actress) back in top form!",9,pos
Annihilation,"I don't review films, but I felt I had to counter the ""one star"" ratings from people who evidently didn't ""get"" this modern sci-fi masterpiece. I have to say I'm baffled by the extremely low reviews from some people, especially those who claim they went to sleep during the movie (is it fair to give it one star if you didn't see all of it?), or those who claim they are doing it to counter the ""fake"" ten star reviews. 
 
 I am giving this a ten because this movie single-handedly restored my faith in cinema as capable of giving me an ""experience"" in the theater. This is not a perfect film. That's not why I gave it a ten. I gave it a ten because of its vision and its impact. I'd say it's a cross between Alien, Arrival, Monsters, and 2001. If you don't like films that create an environment and put you in it to experience something, you probably won't like this. It's not a straight linear sci-fi film where you will have all your questions answered. Instead, it will make you think about what life and death is, about what ties us together, and it will give you a few scares along the way, and show you things you have never seen in other films. It will also convey how important the soundtrack can be in a film.
 
 It's tragic that other countries didn't get a chance to see this in the theater. For anyone watching this overseas on Netflix, I recommend you watch on the largest television you can find with the best sound system you can get, and crank it. If you have to bribe your friend with the 70"" television and Atmos sound system, do it. It's worth it to experience this film to the fullest. I wish I could see it for the first time again in the theater.
 
 If you've read the book, Garland says this was created as a sort of ""dream"" of the book, and it's only roughly based on that work. If you have read the book first, you need to reset your expectations going in.
 
 Again, this is not a ""paid"" review, it's not a ""fake"" review. I experienced what I can only describe as a near-religious experience in the theater watching this film, and a repeated view at home brought all those feelings back. It's a tremendous work, and I can't wait to see what Garland does next.",10,pos
Roma,"Every now and then a movie comes along that reviewers who want to appear sophisticated and ""in the know"" feel compelled to heap all kinds of praise upon. This is one of those movies. Boring, slow, tedious, and lame don't begin to describe it. Hate is a strong word, but it is the only appropriate one to describe my feeling towards this waste of film. I honestly don't see how any real human being could like or enjoy this movie, and I suspect that very few actually did, despite their phony reviews.",1,neg
Roma,"You will lost 2 hours of your life watching it, even when the picture is really beautiful.
 
 No drama, no storyline, no meaning, and some of the events in time are wrong.

Roma,"iggest problem for me was almost a complete lack of three dimensional characters. I guess the main woman the film follows around was the main protagonist, but I felt like I was watching paint dry. There was an emotional void in the performances and the film's basic lack of any sort of story or direction. Lots of dramatic scenes came off rather silly, generating more chuckles than any sort of real feelings.
 
 I gave it 3 out of 10, giving it one point for cinematography, one point for it being a finished film, and one point just because people seemed to like it. I have to wonder have A. Cuaron was thinking when he shot this screenplay (if there was an actual screenplay - maybe it was improv?).",3,neg
Roma,"Before I even start my review, I must say that despite how good this film may be, Roma may be one of the most overrated films of all time. It was so ridiculously overhyped that I think it affected my experience just a smidge. I mean, come on people, I did not start to levitate after the credits rolled. I would almost call this the Infinity War or the Dark Knight of overrated foreign films.
 
 With all of that being said (lol I don't mean to trash the film, just the people who are overhyping it), I sincerely enjoyed Roma. With such pristine cinematography, editing, and long takes, I couldn't believe how Alfonso Cuaron dedicated so much time and effort for his very simplistic story. The story follows a domestic worker who works as a maid for a mother of four children, where she deals with the struggles of the job and her own personal troubles, amidst a troubled period in Mexico during the 1970s. Despite the simplistic story, I was incredibly moved by the main actor and all of the supporting cast, who most have surprisingly only starred in this film.
 
 There were several scenes in this film that deeply moved me (in positive and negative ways); one involving a pregnancy and one during a trip to a beach, in particular. Even when the film is not moving you, there are tons of moments that are full of laughter, especially a couple scenes involving narrow spaces. From laughter to emotion to even really uncomfortable weird scenes, Cuaron does an extremely great job at conveying all types of feelings for the viewer.
 
 The two pinnacle components of Roma that really caught my attention were the long-takes and background characters. The long-takes were extremely well done, when they were not done in an attempt to show how many long takes the director can fit into one film. There are so many scenes in this film that are all filmed in one-take, and whenever Cuaron pulls it off in the right way, it really conveys many amazing feelings. The one on the beach is unforgettable. Even the long take during the opening credits is spectacular. Many of the takes are extraordinary, but it is worth noting that some are just done just because, and really have no merit. Like, do I need to see our main character walk up the stairs for two minutes? No, I do not.
 
 The other thing that really caught my attention were the background characters because every single individual person in the background had their own story. A scene in a theater was done so well, that you could look at any person or couple in the audience, and they would all be doing something so unique and different. Any scene throughout the film that had background characters were all doing something special, and it makes me feel like Cuaron gave direction to every single individual. It felt like I was watching real people, and it was amazing.
 
 As for complaints, the film does go a little style over substance in some cases. Like I said, the story is simplistic, well-done, and I did care a lot, but the long takes do become a little over-indulgent. I just wish that instead of the director having the need to praise his own skills, that we would just get back to the story at hand. Also, not really a complaint on the film or anything, but people, this is not the best movie ever made.
 
 Regardless, the film is a very high eight out of ten. I really do love Roma.
 
 PS: It is worth noting that The Chambermaid was trying to pull off a lot of what this film was trying to do, but the latter exceeded in every possible way.",8,pos
Roma,"The story of Cleo and her 'family' might hit a sensitive chord for many viewers who grew up not just in Mexico but in any Third-World country, maybe not just in the 70s but probably the 80s or early 90s.
 
 By no means am I depriving the story from its cultural core but it was Roger Ebert who said: ""The more specific a film is, the more universal, because the more it understands individual characters, the more it applies to everyone."" Still, it's not just about the characters, I could relate to the context as well on a superficial but still deeply personal level.
 
 Coming from a middle-class family of Morocco, we also had these girls who came from poorer backgrounds (generally rural areas) and whose treatment would look a bit like slavery from a European/""Western"" standpoint. The term wouldn't be appropriate though as they were paid, certainly not mistreated and in most cases were considered like members of the family. Not all the ladies of the house treated them with respect but they were often loved by the kids as sister-figures or even surrogate mothers. I was practically raised by the same 'dada' from the age of 4, she dressed me, woke me up, cleaned me till I was 8 (my daughter does it alone since she's 3) and well, she was part of my life and I miss her a lot.
 
 I could relate to the story of Cleo and I was glad that the film didn't take the predictable ""clash of the classes"" path: having her fired, being rejected or ending as a prostitute in some brothel of Mexico City... Cuaron is above these tiresome archetypes and his intention is clearly to take the opportunity of a nostalgic voyage through his childhood to show people with a strong capability of caring and being empathetic regardless of their origins or social backgrounds. And Cleo, played with mesmerizing naturalness by Yalitza Aparicio, is obviously a girl to inspire the very feelings she exudes: she loves the children she saw growing up since the cradle, she's devoted to her ""Signora"" Sofia, played by Marina de Tavira, and she values her luck to be part of that world... she knows she could have been unluckier.
 
 It's also interesting that Cleo isn't conventionally good-looking, not in a glamorous Hollywood sense anyway, and her petite frame and youthful face illuminated with a wide smile accentuate her vulnerability. She incarnates a sort of third world within the third world, like an extra layer of fragility making her the perfect target for the kind of troubles no upper class European looking girl would get herself into. Though the film is overarched by the social and political context of Mexico circa 1970-71, I didn't feel like Cuaron tried to make some social commentary, maybe it's just a character study of a woman who could only depend on the kindness of strangers, like Blanche Dubois, but is able to find some inner strength to overcome a blind (but not malicious) adversity if not triumph over it.
 
 And indeed, in her harrowing journey (that doesn't follow any pattern of cinematic predictability), it's less in what happens to her than the reactions it inspires. The film is less driven by plot points but the way people react and reactions to their reactions... or non-reactions for that matter. There is an interesting scene where a Karate master shows a trick that looks extremely easy until it's done with closed eyes, I don't know if it was supposed to symbolize one of the film's underlying messages, but it's true that many things that happen are due to people's obliviousness, carelessness or lack of empathy. And near the end, both Cleo and Sofia realize they had more in common than they would have thought, adversity strikes everyone... only in different ways. Blind again, but not malicious.
 
 What I liked in ""Roma"", besides its realism, is the fact that it doesn't just try to depict a slice of life but Life with a major L, providing sights often suggested but rarely shown in the movies. Indeed, the film contains many graphic sequences including a naked male body (and I'm sorry to say that it's more distracting for me than a woman's... maybe because the thing ""moves""... chuckles) and one that shouldn't be spoiled but that had me almost gasping with tears because it was the moment where many aspects of an editing that demanded some patience from us finally paid off, and I knew I had to expect a high spot of emotionality sometime in the film. Cuaron's ""Roma"" (whatever the title means) is truly daring by showing life and death with the same clinical detachment from his lenses, one that also shows in the climactic scene, hinted by the poster.
 
 Now, I wanted to give he film a 10 because it has reached a cinematic level of perfection I rarely found in a movie but sometimes its beauty just feels so deliberate it becomes sophisticated. The film benefits from Alfonso Cuaron's perfect command of the camera (we're obviously talking of the Oscar-winner for Best Cinematography and maybe Best Director) but the cinematography tends to steal the story's thunder and compromises the film's attempt to be a realistic portrait of a Mexican's slice of life in the 70s in an atmosphere of love devoid of the cynicism we get from today's dysfunctional families. The children in the film are not only adorable but played with an authentic simplicity and since so many directors said it was a nightmare to direct children, Cuaron deserves a credit for that too.
 
 So It's precisely because the story is so well told and well acted that I wished it wouldn't be so well directed... though I approve the choice of the black-and-white for no other reason that it gives the film a sort of dreamy aura fitting its nostalgia.
 
 Overall, ""Roma"" is a great film with a few haunting moments.",9,pos
Roma,"Because it f#cking is.
 
 The movie almost flawless. I mean how do you depict this material better than this? Every touch of Cuaron leads to this unbelievably immersive chef d'oeuvre. So how the f#ck do you think to criticize it? You're gonna call it boring and pretentious? You're unsure of what the movie's trying to say about Cleo's life and her status? Is the film runs on and on, seemingly without organization or end? You think this is merely a vacant filmic vessel. You find the story thin and the characters uninteresting? Are the shots linger far longer than they are interesting? Is the film dragged out? Well, I have news for you my brother. Our father always secretly hated you. What makes this movie masterpiece is the things you criticize for. There are some disabled bloggers on Rotten Tomatoes confusing this film with some high budget Hollywood films. Please don't mind them, they're just trying to clickbaiting you. They probably don't even know what the real filmmaking is. And this is why today's film industry is swimming in sh‚ùót. Do you guys have any idea how hard it is to film a scene using only one camera without any cuts with 50+ people acting their role all in harmony? Because I f#cking don't. It's just absurd how people giving this film a 1/10 rating and The Avengers 10/10. I guess some people will never comprehend the depth that Alfonso Cuaron puts in his works. But he will never be served, his spot is forever reserved. We should all be kissing his Aüí≤üí≤ for creating a hardworking and unique piece of work like this. This movie is the best thing to happen to cinema history since Children of Men. Too bad Alfonso Cuaron isn't getting enough credit for his doings. He's one of those directors who knows exactly how to capture a moment. The perfection on that sea scene at the end of the movie is at its finest. The way the camera moves, the way the intenseness intensifies, the way how Cuaron ends that scene is just top notch.
 
 PS. The reason why the movie 'almost' flawless, there were two scenes which were way over the top:
 
 First one is the fire in the woods. While everybody was partying some guy yelled ''there is a fire'' and then everybody went to put out the fire with buckets in their hands like they were expecting that moment to happen. Now, to me, this was something that bugged my mind. It just felt contrived. It could've been executed more subtlety.
 
 The other one is the scene where Cleo trying to find the kids in the streets(Time mark is around 1:10:58) Now you can call this a reach, but I still want to share how I feel about this. The immersiveness was just way too over the top. I don't know if this just something special for me but the people were acting so lively. I felt like I was in a movie studio. I mean you could tell that people were there to act and the products were there to be filmed. It just wasn't natural. The same formula also used in the other scenes but I never felt this kind of unnaturalness in those scenes. They all looked genuine and realistic except the one I pointed.",10,pos
Eight Grade,"This movie was beyond horrible. I wanted a comedy movie and didn't laugh once. I cringed so much! The pace of the movie didn't make much sense (about her and Aiden and all). No character development at all and this was basically the point of the movie ???? Don't waste your time, you'll hate yourself afterwards. I don't know, I honestly couldn't relate at all, this coming from a girl who was kinda quiet herself.",1,neg
Eight Grade,"Who can relate to a young girls' drama, when there is no drama or arc. There was a time when growing up had a lot more to tell than, a complex emotional journey with a lot to tell.
 
 The shallow sensitivity and the big ""theme"" that everyone wants to be special and different, is pictured a lot. The only thing that made the protagonist special is that she had a lot of problems without actually having a problem and maybe a broken iphone.
 
 The reason I am writing this review is that I keep wondering, how this movie can be considered as a Masterpiece when the culture of this so-called new generation has no philosophic background and just float behind a screen on a 24-7 basis. As the years pass by, the American Cinema has less and less to offer, makes me wonder if humans over there have become empty shells.",2,neg
Eight Grade,"The trailer was amazing and had been dying to see it. So I started to watch hoping I was gonna love it. Starts a little slow compared to how the trailer painted it. (The opening monologue is way too long)
 
 A few extras looking too much into the camera in a distracting way and overdoing their background work. A few camera shots were jarring and distracting. Minor things, but surprised.
 
 Too much music driving the scenes. It almost starts to feel like a music video. As soon as one song stopped and it felt like just being a movie instead of a musical montage, another track started. By the pool that started to get REALLY annoying. Less music and quicker cuts would have been better. Music was also too loud. Whoever was in charge of the music should be fired. What a shame.
 
 JESUS!! They literally could not let the movie play for 30 seconds without starting a new track!! It went throughout the whole movie, until toward the end. It ruined it!!
 
 No coherent story. Just random scenes that constantly digressed from one focus to another. No one story-line ever really completed. It was almost like it wasn't written, but not in a good way. Sometimes I felt it was overwritten so it was odd.
 
 Some of the scenes were a little too forced and unnatural like they were pushing the cringe too much and not creating a balance of emotions. Some were just straight up staged like the hallway where she faces the two popular girls who are ignoring her on their phones.
 
 There was a lot of humor inferred in the trailer, but it was actually mostly cringe and very little humor.
 
 SO DISAPPOINTED! It was the ONE movie of the year I was looking forward to that looked the most promising.",3,neg
Eight Grade,"This movie was emotional for me for reasons I'm not sure how to express. It was very relatable and well-made, making you absolutely feel for the protagonist in every way. Everything about it was spot-on to me. It made me cry very hard in the middle, cry in the car, and tear up throughout the day afterwards. It's definitely worth the watch.",8,pos
Eight Grade,"Eighth Grade' is a movie you'll be talking about for a long time. Bo Burnham, one of the O.G.'s of teen YouTube stardom, has given us an agonizingly rich and authentic look at what life is like for Kayla (Elsie Fisher), a shy 13-year-old girl in today's social media obsessed world. Burnham, directing his first feature, doesn't spare any detail and doesn't alter any truth. 
 
 This film is exceedingly honest. It doesn't depict Kayla's experiences the way we might think they should be for an eighth grader or the way we might want them to be-they're simply presented as they are. Pool parties are a source of unbearable discomfort. First sexual encounters are not always pleasant. Kids with exploding hormones and little impulse control randomly shout unfunny phrases at assemblies in the hopes of earning a laugh.
 
 The storytelling has the feel of a nature documentary. We can almost hear the narrator describing Kayla's attempts to navigate her fascinating and frightening terrain. Playing the vulnerable character who's far from the top of the food chain, she's just trying to survive. 
 
 Kayla, like so many kids her age, is a shy girl pretending to be confident. She posts advice videos to YouTube on how to be yourself, something with which she still very much struggles. As she records one video, she slowly rolls her chair farther away from the camera, indicating a declining level of self-assurance. This mirrors her real-world peer interactions, in which she stammers and laughs halfway through sentences as she begins to doubt herself and shrink with embarrassment, not that the self-absorbed ""listener"" bothers to notice.
 
 All the kids stare at their phones constantly. These modern mean girls barely bother to muster up the energy put others down with a passive-aggressive remark because that would involve speaking to another person. Instead, they inflict harm by neglecting to acknowledge an uncool kid's mere existence. As cruel as that sounds, these popular kids aren't presented as villains. This is simply their way of handling their own insecurities. There are no villains in eighth grade-they're all just kids trying to figure out their lives and trying to figure out themselves.
 
 And the adults don't know how to handle any of this. Kayla's dad wants to connect with her, but is met with constant rejection. He smartly gives her space and only requests her attention to remind her how much he loves her. In one scene, Kayla asks if she makes him sad, and he fervently reassures her that she makes him profoundly happy. Like Kayla, he can't always find the right words, but he successfully expresses the feeling. 
 
 That scene is a microcosm of the entire film. Its dialogue isn't readily quotable or particularly memorable, and that's okay. What is actually said isn't as important as the meaning behind it. 
 
 Parents can keep this in mind when they have conversations with their own kids, possibly directly after watching this film. Many kids and parents will likely watch it together since it carries an ""R"" rating (it's ironic that a film that accurately reflects the lives of eighth graders is deemed too adult for them to watch on their own). And parents should watch this with their kids, so they can both understand each other a little bit better. They'll both be better for doing so.",9,pos
Eight Grade,"I was introduced to Bo Burnham by my adult children who found his stand-up specials funny. I watched and found him extremely talented with an underlying sadness.
 
 I expected this movie to be uproarious with an undercurrent of teenage angst. Instead, it was incredibly poignant and moving. In fact, it was so painful atbpkints I found it difficult to watch.
 
 In the scene where she drops her cell phone due to excitement of being invited to the mall by an older friend, my eyes began to well up with tears.
 
 It is one of the most realistic movies regarding youth that I have ever seen.
 
 A painful watch but well worth it. Burnham has a big future ahead of him.",10,pos
